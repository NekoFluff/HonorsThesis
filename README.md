# Honors Thesis

run the following line to create the NN recommendation model. 
```python
python user_item_recommendation.py
```

run the following line to print out the first user embedding vector and item embedding vector
```python
python get_embeddings.py
```

I will clean out the files and make it easier to use once I find an NN from a repuatable paper and make it work with my data. -Alex
